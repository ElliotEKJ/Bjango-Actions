# Bjango Actions 3.0.1 Tweak

A small update to [Marc Edwards](https://twitter.com/marcedwards)' fantastic [Bjango Actions](https://github.com/bjango/Bjango-Actions). The scale actions now collapse all of the groups and layer style summaries once they've finished running. This tweak requires Photoshop CC and, of course, the [rest of the Bjango Actions bundle](https://github.com/bjango/Bjango-Actions). Just load this .atn file instead of the one in the main bundle.
